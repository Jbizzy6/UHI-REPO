### Lesson 1: introduction to design thinking

enterprise design thinking is about taking the time to understand your clients and their needs so you can align yourself and your team around a clear purpose to better understand your goals and requirements.

#### design thinking is for everyone
- anyone can practice design thinking
- design thinking is a problem solving approach that aims to improve peoples experiences

#### what's an experience
- design thinking requires you to consider a persons experience in order to focus on their human needs
- an experience is the way a person feels and what they think while doing something

users are the people who interact with the item, product, service, offering, or system that you make.

enterprise businesses don't typically focus and face small problems, rather larger scale issues that shape the world around them. these problems require a special form of design thinking that can cover the scale and complexity that people face in daily life

### the enterprise design thinking framework

this section of the course aims to explore the vocabulary of enterprise design thinking by teaching a framework that allows us to speak about design thinking across large teams and stay aligned through the use of a shared language

Enterprise design thinking is IBM's tailor made approach for applying design thinking to large scale teams.

#### The principles
- A focus on user outcomes, Restless reinvention, Diverse and empowered teams 

#### The loop
- the loop helps us to understand the present and envision the future in a continuous cycle of observing, reflecting, and making
- observe, reflect, make

#### The keys 
- the keys are scalable practices for enterprise team alignment
- Hills, playbacks, sponsor users

#### principles
- A focus on user outcomes - drive business by helping users achieve their goals. start with peoples needs, not solutions
- restless reinvention - stay essential by treating everything as a prototype. Teams revisit and rethink their ideas, seek feedback, and improve their solutions over time
- diverse empowered teams - move faster by working together and embracing a variety of perspectives. this type of collaboration allows the best ideas and solutions to emerge

#### Loop
- Observe - Immerse yourself in the real world with design research. Interview users, watch them work, and test your ideas with the people who matter most to inform your decision making and understanding.
- reflect - Come together with your team and look within to synchronize your movements, synthesize what you’ve learned, and share your “aha” moments with each other. Decide together and move forward with confidence.
- make - Give concrete form to abstract ideas. The earlier you make, the faster you learn. Share your ideas with others before they’re complete and improve them as you go.

#### Keys
- hills - Align your team around the meaningful user outcomes you want to achieve. **Hills** are statements of intent (the underlying purpose or goal) written as user outcomes. They follow a format of Who, What, and Wow: 

- **Who:** Who are your users? Refer to them by name. 
    
- **What:** What will your users be able to do that they couldn’t before? Start with a verb and avoid solutions. 
    
- **Wow:** What differentiates you from the competition? This is measurable.

- playbacks - Stay aligned by regularly exchanging feedback. **Playbacks** are story-based presentations that share insights, ideas, and updates to a user experience.

- sponsor users - Invite users into the work and stay true to real-world needs. **Sponsor Users** are external clients, future clients, or end users that represent your target user, who regularly contribute domain expertise to your team. Relationships with Sponsor Users are typically formalized with an agreement that covers confidentiality and the right for teams to use their feedback.

these ideas of principles, loop, and keys are what form the framework behind enterprise design thinking

### Lesson 2: a focus on user outcomes
success with enterprise design thinking isn't measured by how many features they build or how fast they launch the product, its measured by how well people reach their goals. when teams focus on the user outcomes instead of just building features they create solutions that are useful and meaningful

#### identify your users and their problems
- complexity and ambiguity - enterprise teams handle complex ecosystems that take years to learn and perfect. they offer countless dilemmas, predicaments, and any other ambiguous situations you can think of. finding enough clarity to decide on the best thing to do. in design thinking the most important thing is people. this is called a focus on user outcomes.
#### a focus on user outcomes 
every time you ask who are our users, what's their current experience, how can it be improved, you get closer to understanding the user and their needs and in the modern day a users needs are usually market needs meaning creating meaningful user experiences is directly tied to business success.

#### Business problems to human-centred problems
business problems are often focused on something nonhuman such as making money or improving brand recognition. in order to start focusing on your users you need to identify the user problems that underlie your business problems. successful outcomes occur when user needs are balanced with business goals and technical limits.

5 whys - thinking back to the Windsor airlines problem using a 5 whys approach can help identify user centred problems that underlie the business problem. the original business problem was - consistent flight delays are negatively affecting the company's financial performance. after going through a 5 whys approach we determined that the user centred problem was - consistent flight delays are effecting the company's financial performance because gate agents struggle to negotiate last minute passenger changes

Next, you need to work to understand these users’ current experience. At its core, design thinking is the process of understanding the situation, recognizing where it can be improved, and then creating a better future for the people involved. This is the concept of moving from **as-is** to **to-be**.

#### Recognize your assumptions
when we work off of our own assumptions based on our own viewpoints instead of the users viewpoints we can come to conclusions that might be incomplete or wrong entirely. in order to combat this we need to address our assumptions by learning, observing, and practising design research. 

design research is the practice of inquiry and discovery that builds knowledge, insight, and empathy for your users


### Lesson 3: Restless reinvention
restless reinvention means continuing to improve your work so that it stays helpful and important to the people who use it. its about staying curious and willing to adjust. this lesson will teach the idea of treating everything as a prototype.

restless reinvention is a principle of enterprise design thinking that represents active, continuous testing and learning in order to improve the solution to a problem

view everything as a prototype. if we look at our work as a work in progress we can begin to shift our mindset from waiting until something is perfect to waiting until something is ready.

### Lesson 4: Diverse Empowered Teams
to tackle the challenges of the modern day we need the combined strength of a well-structured team instead of individual effort. teams with multiple varied perspectives can help generate new and innovative ideas.

a single viewpoint can limit the output of work. that's why collaboration across team members and sometimes even other teams can help ensure stronger and more well rounded outcomes.

Diverse teams have varied perspectives, skills, and backgrounds. they build on each others ideas, enrich each others knowledge, and challenge each others assumptions in ways that benefit and accelerate the work.

Empowered teams have the agency to make everyday operational decisions on their own. They're equipped with the expertise and authority to deliver outcomes. 

**Diverse Empowered Teams**, an Enterprise Design Thinking Principle, represents how a group of people with varied perspectives can successfully make decisions together and work toward shared goals.

when working in these kinds of teams its important to watchout for pitfalls that may come from the range of different viewpoints and methods of working and thinking. its important to identify weather or not your team is actually aligned.

**Playbacks**, an Enterprise Design Thinking Key, are story-based presentations that bring stakeholders and whole teams together in a safe space to exchange feedback.

there are some key areas where teams need to be aligned. these include starting a new project, deciding on a future experience for your users, and reviewing progress as you deliver

### Lesson 5: make a plan
this lesson will teach more about problem statements and teach how to craft a problem statement to frame our own work aligned to user outcomes

a problem statement helps teams answer the question of "where do we start?" by putting the user front and centre, aligning everyone around a clear issue to solve. problem statements are often the foundation of hills, hills being human-focused mission statements that describe a future enablement for a specific user.

one formula for problem statements is as follows - our user struggles to achieve some task today because of blocks, limitations, or other issues.
