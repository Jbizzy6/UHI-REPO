so after spending the past two days researching I finally feel confidant enough to start writing my own API.

to start I initialized my project and created a new GitHub project with the Node `.gitignore` template. I'm unsure if its the correct template to use and I could of used AI to generate a git ignore for me however I want to try avoid using AI so ill trust it for now and attempt to deal with potential problems down the line.

I then added on my packages, those being express, a number of babel packages, nodemon, and body-parser
```json
"dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^2.2.0",
    "express": "^5.1.0",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.10"
  },
"devDependencies": {
    "@babel/cli": "^7.28.3",
    "@babel/core": "^7.28.4",
    "@babel/node": "^7.28.0",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.28.3"
  }
```

these packages are the same ones we installed for the tutorial project apart from the mongoDB packages as I will not be working with mongoDB for my project and will instead be using in-memory data

I also added the required babel configuration file 
```
{
    "presets": [
        "@babel/preset-env"
    ]
}
```

I then created my directory tree, storing my data in a data folder and storing my routes in a routes folder, using a different JavaScript file for each route as is best practice.

next I created my in memory data that will be used by the API,  this is the data I came up with
```javascript
let about = {
    name: "Joshua Ross",
    studyYear: "year 2",
    basedIn: "Moray",
    goals: "Complete year 2 and learn game development"
};

let projects = [
    {id: 1, title: "RoR2 Mod", description: "a project to develop a mod for risk of rain 2, primarily aimed at adding a new playable survivor"},
    {id: 2, title: "Personal Website", description: "a project to build a personal website"},
    {id: 3, title: "Example Project", description: "this is an example"}
];

let feedback = [];

module.exports = {about, projects, feedback};
```

my next task was to start up the server in the `index.js` and test it on my localhost, I'm aware that for completion of this task I'm required to host the API outside of my localhost however my plan is to build the entire API, make sure everything works and then attempt to host it on the cloud. that way if I run out of time to do the hosting I still have a working API I can present. this largely follows the same strategy as the linked in tutorial. first I inserted this script into the `package.json`
`"start": "nodemon ./index.js --exec babel-node"`. I then created our app, set our port, built the first endpoint to test the localhost and built the listener.

at this point I began to confuse myself with my routes, mainly if they are supposed to be within my index.js file or in separate route files like originally planned, after doing some searching I eventually concluded that I may need to make use of express routing to have my routes in separate files. at this point I decided to keep my endpoints in my index and then move them later as an additional task. I wrote my GET endpoints for `About` and `Projects` and was getting ready to do research on `POST` for the `Feedback`.  I also decided to add in `PUT` and `DELETE` methods as an extra task for later but for now they are blocked out in comments. this is what my code looks like so far
```javascript
const express = require('express');

//create app and set port
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

//import data
const { about } = require('./src/data/data');
const { projects } = require('./src/data/data');
const { feedback } = require('./src/data/data');

//GET endpoints
app.get('/about', (req, res) =>
    res.json(about)
);

app.get('/projects', (req, res) =>
    res.json(projects)
);

//POST endpoints

//PUT endpoints

//DELETE endpoints

//listen for the server
app.listen(PORT, () =>
    console.log(`your server is running on port ${PORT}`)
);
```

I found an article on Medium written by Ravi Patel entitled "REST-API CRUD Operations Using Express.js and In-Memory Database" -- https://medium.com/@ravipatel.it/rest-api-crud-operations-using-express-js-and-in-memory-database-0fb0989a708f

reading it told me I need to parse incoming requests into json data using middleware (middleware is something id like to do more research on as the definition I learned in the LinkedIn tutorial is not entirely clear to me). it gave me this line of code to use for the data parsing
```javascript
// Middleware to parse JSON requests  
app.use(express.json());
```

I then learned that I need to structure my post request with the fields the user must fill out. this is the example the article gave
```json
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {  
const newUser = {  
id: database.length + 1, // Auto-generate an ID  
name: req.body.name,  
age: req.body.age  
};  
  
database.push(newUser); // Add the new user to the database  
res.status(201).json(newUser); // Return the new user with a 201 status code  
});
```

here is what I wrote to fit the purposes of allowing a user to give me feedback
```javascript
app.post('/feedback', (req, res) => {
    //creates new feedback with an id and a body for the feedback text
    const newFeedback = {
        id: feedback.length + 1,
        feedbackDetails: req.body.feedbackDetails
    };

    feedback.push(newFeedback); //adds new feedback to the end of the feedback array
}
);
```
