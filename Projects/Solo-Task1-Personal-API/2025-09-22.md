the goal of this task is to build and document our own personal API. for this task I will be using Node.js / Express as suggested in the tasks project brief. to get myself started on this task I will follow the two linked in learning courses provided by the project brief to build up my understanding and find a place to start.

### Creating API Documentation -- https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-api-documentation/introduction-to-apis?u=56746241 presented by Deepa Maddala

1.API Foundations 

what is an API
- stands for Application Program Interface
- acts as an interface between two programs or systems
- Organisations share public data through their APIs by using endpoints
- many organizations use APIs created by other organizations for their own projects

Types of APIs
- we are referring to web APIs that use HTTP protocols just like webpages
- are typically categorized into four types based on their access levels and scope of use
- these are Open, Partner, Internal, and Composite APIs

- Open APIs (also called external APIs) are available for anyone to use
- they typically have no to low authorization and authentication
- may be free or subscription based
- makes APIs more valuable when third party businesses use them
- for consumers these APIs are readily available without many restrictions

- Partner APIs are used by businesses who are collaboration and partnering together on a project or projects
- these Require stronger authorization to avoid public usage
- may have license keys for security reasons
- more control over who can use and gain access to information

- Internal APIs used within organisations between teams
- not for public use
- used for communication between systems and applications within the business
- when a new system is built it interacts with the existing systems using these APIs

- Composite APIs combine multiple API requests and allow users to get a single response from multiple servers
- these are used when developers need to fetch data from multiple servers or sources
- this reduces the total number of API calls thus improving performance and speed


2.API Documentation

what is it
- acts as a user manual for an API
- explains everything about our API and what it can do
- explains the complete functionality
- explains the most efficient way to use an API
- explains how to integrate and use the API
- the documentation can be written by hand however automated tools exist to produce the documentation for us

what is its importance
- good documentation benefits developers as it makes the API easier to consume, allows people who do not have a technology background to understand our API, Saves time onboarding developers allowing them to use the API quickly and efficiently, if the documentation is well written any questions about the API should be able to be answered by the documentation saving time and money instead of spending time looking for answers, good documentation will allow for easy maintainability and updates, allows for more popularity with the API.

3.Components of API Documentation

API Components

name
- should be meaningful to the API
- should give an idea as to what the API is in only a few words

Description
- does not include the technical aspect of the API
- Should talk about the Business use case

Endpoint
- used for communication and data transfer
- every touchpoint in the communication channel is an endpoint
- it can be boiled down to being a fancy name for a URL of a a database or service
- in the documentation we give the base URL at the start of the page and the part that keeps changing is given as a separate endpoint in different sections

Authorization and Authentication
- Authentication checks who has access
- Authorization checks what we can do
- we can have different kinds of authorization for different levels of security
- these being No authentication which is usually used for internal APIs, Basic authentication which asks the user for a username and password with every API call, Secure token which generates a very long and unique token with every call, and OAuth which automatically approves access to specific developers
- if our API uses any kind of authorization we need to document it, including if it has no authentication

Parameters
- the variable part of the resource
- include the name, value, and description
- some parameters are required for the API call while others are optional
- we need to list all parameter names and a description as to why we need that parameter

Headers
- similar to parameters
- used to send additional information e.g. Metadata about our request to the server
- handled in the same way more or less as parameters in the documentation

Request and Response body
- Request has attributes with values assigned to them
- when is a request is sent a response is received so we must show an example request and response in our documentation

Success and Error codes
- examples of codes the consumer may receive when interacting with our API
- we must also keep a record of what each of these codes signify

Best practices for documentation
- Language must be simple
- Less technical
- well organized
- ideally autogenerated
- interactive

tools such as Swagger, Postman and confluence can be used to automatically generate documentation



before continuing on to the other LinkedIn learning course I spent the rest of the day re-learning JavaScript as I have not used it in a very long time, this mainly involved following along with YouTube videos and articles
